# Async Job Contract
- Results auto-deliver. A settled `hub jobs`/`hub wait` snapshot is the delivery; no duplicate `async-result` follows.
- Job IDs are process-local and expire roughly five minutes after settlement. Afterward, use the agent ID with `hub send`, `agent://<id>`, or `history://<id>`.
- `completed` means successful yield/job exit, not artifact acceptance. Verify claimed changes.
{{/if}}

# Task Design
- **Agent typing:** Pick each item's `agent` type. Read-only research MUST use `agent: "scout"` (faster model). Use default worker only when no specialist fits.
- **No overhead:** Each `task` MUST instruct its agent to skip formatters, linters, and project-wide test suites. Run those once at the end.
- **One-pass:** Prefer agents that investigate AND edit in one pass; spin a read-only scout only when affected files are genuinely unknown.
- **Overlap is safe:** Concurrent edits to the same files auto-resolve{{#if ircEnabled}}; worst case, agents coordinate directly over IRC{{/if}}. NEVER shrink or serialize a batch to avoid file overlap. Two prerequisites:
  1. Every task MUST skip validation (build/lint/tests) — validating mid-flight blocks agents on each other's edits.
  2. Decide cross-task contracts up front (e.g. the interface A implements and B consumes) and state them in the {{#if batchEnabled}}batch `context`{{else}}task{{/if}}, not left for agents to negotiate.

# Inputs
{{#if batchEnabled}}
- `context`: Shared project state, constraints, and contracts. Applies to the entire batch; do not duplicate this background into individual tasks.
- `tasks[]`: Array of subagents to spawn.
  - `name`: A stable CamelCase identifier (≤32 chars), used to address the agent (IRC, job ids). Generated automatically if omitted.
  - `agent`: The agent type running this item (e.g. `scout`, `reviewer`). Omitting it gives you the general-purpose worker (`{{defaultAgent}}`) — NEVER pass that name explicitly. Only omit it after checking the agent list below and finding no specialist that fits.{{#if allowedAgentsText}} Current spawn policy allows: {{allowedAgentsText}}.{{/if}}
  - `task`: Complete, self-contained instructions. One-liners or missing acceptance criteria are PROHIBITED.
{{#if effortEnabled}}  - `effort`: Scale w/ complexity of this task: `"lo"`|`"med"`|`"hi"`
{{/if}}
  - `outputSchema`: Invocation-specific JSON Schema. Overrides the selected agent and parent-session schemas.
  - `schemaMode`: `"permissive"` (default) accepts a retry-exhausted invalid result with a warning; `"strict"` fails it.
{{#if isolationEnabled}}
{{#if applyIsolatedChanges}}
  - `isolated`: Run in a dedicated worktree; successful changes are automatically applied to the parent checkout.
{{else}}
  - `isolated`: Run in a dedicated worktree; changes are retained as patch or branch artifacts without modifying the parent checkout.

{{/if}}
- `toolProfile`: Optional least-privilege tool shorthand: `none`, `inspect`, `review`, `edit`, `plan`, `web-research`, or `vision`. It can only restrict an agent's tools.
{{#if permissionsEnabled}}
- `permissions`: Least-privilege guardrails. In a batch, set this on each `tasks[]` item. With a `toolProfile`, the effective tools are their intersection; permissions never widen the profile.
  - `profiles`: Permission profile names. Combine a tool-granting profile with modifier profiles as needed.
{{#if permissionToolsEnabled}}
  - `tools`: Optional explicit tool allowlist.
  - `denyTools`: Optional additional hard-deny tool list.
{{/if}}
{{#if permissionPathsEnabled}}
  - `allowPaths`: Files or directories this spawn may access; prefer exact paths.
  - `denyPaths`: Files or directories this spawn must not access.
{{/if}}
{{/if}}
<permission-scoping>
Mode: {{permissionMode}}. Profiles are guardrails, not a security sandbox. Do not ask subagents to bypass them with bash/eval. If work needs access outside scope, the subagent should report the missing permission.

In enforce mode, select at least one permission profile that defines `tools`, or specify `permissions.tools` explicitly. Modifier-only profiles add restrictions and do not grant tools. Path allows and denies accumulate; denies win. When both a `toolProfile` and permissions apply, the effective tool set is their intersection.
